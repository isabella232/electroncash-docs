Welcome to the Electron Cash documentation!
===========================================

**SECURITY ALERT: A JSONRPC security hole was discovered in January 2018 that affects all Electrum forks. This was fully patched in Electron Cash 3.1.2. If you were running a prior version as an online wallet without a strong password, you should consider the wallet compromised, and create a fresh wallet with the latest version of Electron Cash.**

Electron Cash is a lightweight Bitcoin Cash wallet.

Current versions are:

- Windows, Mac, and Linux - 4.0.6
- Android - 3.3.5
- iOS - 4.0.7

Electron Cash can be downloaded from https://electroncash.org/, the `PlayStore <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.electroncash.wallet>`_ or the `App Store <https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/electron-cash/id1359700089?ls=1&mt=8>`_. These are the *only* authentic sources.
